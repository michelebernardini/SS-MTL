# A Semi-Supervised Multi-Task Learning Approach for Predicting Short-Term Kidney Disease Evolution

published in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics by M. Bernardini, L. Romeo, E. Frontoni and M.R. Amini

This work aims to propose a novel Semi-Supervised Multi-Task Learning (SS-MTL) approach for predicting short-term KD evolution on multiple General Practitionersâ€™ Electronics Health Record data. We demonstrated that the SS-MTL approach can (i) capture the eGFR temporal evolution by imposing a temporal relatedness between consecutive time windows and (ii) exploit useful information from unlabeled patients when labeled patients are less numerous with a gain of up to 4.1 % in terms of Recall.

We tested the predictive performance of the SS-MTL approach on the novel mFIMMG dataset, publicly available at the following link: https://vrai.dii.univpm.it/content/mfimmg-dataset

The code will be released soon.
